things to keep in mind: 

streak saver - lets you recover the streak if you missed playing a day

- a field to record the previous streak. 
- when a game is lost or won , then update both previous streak and current streak
- run an sql query to make sure current streak and previous streak are same

streak protection - saves your streak if you lose a game [immediate TODO]

- protects the streak if the user loses a game
